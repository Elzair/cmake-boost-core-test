* boost-core-test

This is a simple example for my CMake modularization of boost. It uses =boost.core= and all of its dependencies.

* Run

To test the example on a *nix system (like Linux or Mac OSX), open a shell and run the following commands.

#+begin_src sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Elzair/cmake-boost-core-test.git
cd cmake-boost-core-test
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./test_core # This should print "No errors detected."
#+end_src sh
